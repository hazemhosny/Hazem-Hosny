Human Tracking Robot Project
description : our robot tracks the human wearing a specific color of a t-shirt (in our case tracks the yellow T-shirt). The robot detects the yellow T-shirt in the video and with that it takes action based on its position and distance between the camera and T-shirt. In our project we are trying to keep the human in frame always so we make the robot able to stop at a specific distance and also to go backward when reached above teh stop range.
